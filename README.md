## About This Project
<img src="src/Assets/WireFrame-BC.png" alt="rough wireframe of Find An API" width="800">

This modest project application build allows a user to select from a drop-down of categories and see the details of each API for that category. They can also have fun with it and just randomly generate an API. Each detail card allows the user to favorite it for reference later! The selected cards can be seen in the favorites view. 

This final project for Mod 3 of Turing's Frontend program was a challenge because of how open it could be. My understanding of React components passing props and setting state grew a great deal as well as using asynchronous javaScript functions. I was able to successfully implement Router to switch between my Home and Favorites pages. 

Given more time I'd like to add more in depth testing, more polished styling, correct the bugs with the favoriting of cards and allow for deletion from favorites. My favorite part of the entire application is that you can switch back and forth from searching via the form and via the random button yet the results never overlap or conflict with each other! ðŸ¥³ I will be updating my project board to reflect future plans and known issues with the app as it stands.
